title: 'Music'
summary: 'I am a pianist and enjoy listening to live music.'
text: 'I started playing piano when I was 5 years old. I played classical piano for 14 years in music academy. At some point I noticed that I can also play what I hear so I started playing whatever songs out of my head and later also singing. Nowadays I usually just play and sing something. I also enjoy listening to live music, especially good is live jazz, but I do like many other genres too. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
